But we cannot seem to leave, we need more. The island demands it.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe next pages seem to be ripped out and missing.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"We have failed. Many have perished.

The best casting method I have found using resources around me was sand casting.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"The primary ingredient for creating a sand cast is greensand, a mixture of clay flakes and refined sand. This allows for the malleability of creating the shape of tool and weapon heads, or even forming the ingots in which to work from.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"Next, we place the greensand in a flask, crafted with wood, finishing the build of the sand cast flask. We then set the shape, place down some talc powder so the finished produce can be lifted easier, and pour the molten smelted mixture into the cast to let it set and harden.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe book is adorned with crude drawings of each process.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"I have also found I can use limestone powder as the flux to refine ores and remove impurities in the smelting process.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe bottom of the paged is signed with \"James Townsend, the Smithy\"."]

To skip/pass a turn, or to pick up item(s) on the tile you are standing on, press {Bindable.GameIdle} or use {Bindable.GameMoveDirection} with your mouse over your character. If you want to face a direction without moving, you can hold down {Bindable.GameFaceDirection} and your character will face towards your mouse. You can also use {Bindable.GameFaceUp}, {Bindable.GameFaceLeft}, {Bindable.GameFaceDown}, or {Bindable.GameFaceRight} to face up, left, down, or right, again, respectively.

Jumping is also selectable in the actions menu which can help you get out of tight spots, but watch out for the heavy stamina reduction; it's based on your current weight.<br>\n\t\n\t<h3>Using Items</h3><br>\n\t\n\tUse {Bindable.GameItemMenu} when hovering over an item with the mouse to bring up a list of actions you can perform with the item. Using quickslots, you may also perform actions with an item at the press of a bind. To quickslot an item, use the action \"Add to Quickslot\", drag the item to a quickslot, or press any of the quickslot binds ({Bindable.GameQuickSlot1}, {Bindable.GameQuickSlot2}, etc).

If there is a tile in the way of your drop, nothing will happen. You may change this functionality and instead drop the item at your feet with the setting \"Drop at Feet When Blocked\", available in the Gameplay section of the Options menu and the Quick Settings dialog.<br><br>\n\t\n\tTo move an item quickly from your inventory to a container or vice-versa, you may press {Bindable.GameItemQuickMove} when hovering an item.

You may also press {Bindable.GameItemQuickMoveAll} to move all items of the same type.<br><br>\n\t\n\t<h3>More Information</h3><br>\n\t\n\tHovering over elements on screen will typically reveal more information. Tooltips will appear over items. Hovering over crafting items will highlight items used in the craft. Many objects in the world also have tooltips, unless they are disabled.
