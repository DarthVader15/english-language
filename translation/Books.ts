export default books = {
	[Book.IslandPresence]: ["William J. Andrews", `"This island seems to react to my presence. I often have a weird feeling, like something is watching me, but besides the constant barrage of bloodthirsty creatures at my heels, that feeling never leaves me; it follows me even into my dreams. I'm not sure how many more sleepless nights I can lead."<br><br>
	
	"There it is again. I felled a tree. I hear it."<br><br>
	
	"There it is again. I burned a tree. The humming continues."<br><br>
	
	"There it is again, the end. I started a forest fire. It's too loud!"<br><br>
	
	The next pages have undecipherable scribbles and diagrams.`],

	[Book.Treasure]: ["On Treasures", `"The greed that has driven us to these islands now forces us to stay here. Day after day we search for the treasures that brought us to these lands to begin with. Our group of men have discovered several different types of treasure, some even from slaying the ravenous indigenous creatures that seem to roam these islands and caves. But we cannot seem to leave, we need more. The island demands it."<br><br>
	
	The next pages seem to be ripped out and missing.<br><br>
	
	"We have failed. Many have perished. We are missing the final piece. I do not think we can make it much further. We seem to have angered nature itself."`],

	[Book.Deities]: ["Dieties", `The book has the inscription, "Deities" on the spine.<br><br>
	
	"The same three strange symbols seem to appear again and again on artifacts, cave walls, and even old long-ago abandoned buildings. Cross referencing other resources and even some older journals we have found references to deities, spirits, and even Gods. Most likely worshiped by the heathens that used to inhabit these lands. They seem connected to these islands somehow."<br><br>
	
	"The three names seem to be mentioned again and again, Wry, Da, and Aw."`],

	[Book.PastCivilizations]: ["Past Civilizations", `"We have discovered evidence of many battles here. Not only that, but civilizations, skeletal remains, abandoned houses, and much evidence to support some type of apocalyptic scenario."<br><br>
	
	"Not only that, but it seems to happen again and again; the evidence all points to different ages and different points in time. It appears as though no people are able to survive and thrive in these lands, like some force is forbidding human progress."<br><br>
	
	"These ravenous, unabating creatures are not helping matters, that's for sure."`],

	[Book.SandCasting]: ["Sand Casting", `The entire book seems to be stained with various chemicals and powders.<br><br>
	
	"Throughout my metallurgic experiments, I have found the best way to forge iron based tools, weapons, and ingots was to cast large amounts of material to shape it. The best casting method I have found using resources around me was sand casting."<br><br>
	
	"The primary ingredient for creating a sand cast is green sand, a mixture of clay flakes and refined sand. This allows for the malleability of creating the shape of tool and weapon heads, or even forming the ingots in which to work from."<br><br>
	
	"Next, we place the green sand in a flask, crafted with wood, sandstone, rock, or raw clay, finishing the build of the sand cast flask. We then set the shape, place down some talc powder so the finished produce can be lifted easier, and pour the molten smelted mixture into the cast to let it set and harden."<br><br>
	
	The book is adorned with crude drawings of each process.<br><br>
	
	"I have also found I can use limestone powder as the flux to refine ores and remove impurities in the smelting process. Some carbon powder is also required to get a proper hardness to the finished metal."<br><br>
	
	The bottom of the paged is signed with "James Townsend, the Smithy".`],

	[Book.WanderingMerchants]: ["The Wandering Merchants", `Throughout my exploration of the island, I have run across other people, much to my surprise. It appears as they were in a similar state as myself; somehow trapped in these lands, struggling for our lives. In the many cases, these folks were not hostile, and we quickly made friendships.<br><br>

	We traded goods and spoke on our situation. One of the folks drove a very hard bargain for some limestone that I needed. If I was a different type of person, given our secluded setting, I may have simply just taken it through "other means".<br><br>
	
	Although it was always my intent to return to them for trading, try as I might, I could no longer locate them. Either they moved on to other areas or died. Given the circumstances of these harsh lands, Iâ€™m guessing the latter is true.`],

	[Book.TrappersJournal]: ["Trapper's Journal", `Using techniques and skills my father taught to me in my youth, I was successfully able to ward off the monstrosities using traps. The snare and the deadfall become my most useful weapons.<br><br>
	
	I spent days crafting traps and placing them outside my shelter instead of focusing on traditional weaponry. My combat skills are not so great, and I have not found a meaningful resource to craft armor, so trapping appeared to be my best bet to dispatch these creatures.<br><br>
	
	I think I just heard my deadfall squish another giant spider. I'll write more on my improvised spider meat meal. Sadly, cooking is not my forte either.`]
