	[Hint.Durability]: ["Durability", "If you find one of your your tools, weapons or armor is close to breaking from overuse (highlighted with a red border), you will need to repair it using a hammer item or a grindstone. If you can't find or craft an item to repair it, it will soon break completely upon use."],

	[Hint.Death]: ["Death", "Death is permanent. Although you may have died, all of the crafting recipes you have discovered will be ready on your next playthrough. Your milestones will also carry over, providing you multiple starting benefits."],

	[Hint.ConsumingBadThings]: ["Consuming Bad Things", "Ow! Not all edible/drinkable objects should be consumed, at least not without facing the consequences. On the other hand, sometimes it's worth the risk to gain its other effects. Consuming bad things can sometimes result in poisoning."],

	[Hint.FastPickup]: ["Fast Pick-up", "You have just picked up an item from the ground. Sometimes there are multiple items on a tile. Pressing the spacebar or clicking on your character will gather items underneath you without moving."],

	[Hint.Bugs]: ["BUGS!", "Did you find an error? Would you kindly let us know about what happened, so that we may seek to stop this from happening to other players? You can do so by posting the issue in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/app/379210/discussions/1/\">Steam Discussions Bug Reports forum</a>."],

	[Hint.HeldItems]: ["Held Items", "Your left and right hand equipment slots are interchangeable. You can equip two weapons, two tools, two shields or any combination in between. With both the left and right hand options selected, you will use both hands (and whatever is equipped in each slot) in combat and in gathering. You can disable either the left or right hands to disable using that one in attacking and gathering. Disabling both will prevent you from attacking or gathering automatically."],

	[Hint.Milestones]: ["Milestones", "Milestones are personalized goals and achievements. Each playthrough, you are given an amount to either discover or work towards. Milestones are saved after each playthrough or death. The more you have completed, the more starting skill and stat points you get, as well as more starting items."],

	[Hint.Burned]: ["Burn Injuries", "Lasting burn injuries and pain can be caused from stepping in an open flame without protection, or possibly other sources. Pouring liquid on yourself will soothe the injuries and pain. Alternatively, you can also take a swim in deep water. Keep swimming until the effect subsides. Being burned will stop you from regenerating health and can last awhile if untreated."],

	[Hint.Crafting]: ["Crafting", "Crafting is simple, but has many rules!<br /><br />When hovering over an item in the crafting window, you will see which items will be used in the craft through a highlighted border that will appear around items in your inventory. You will also notice that you will use the first instance of a required item. Simply drag around the order of items in your inventory or use the sort to use different items in the craft.<br /><br />Using items in a craft that have lower durability will affect the crafted item's durability. Additionally, using remarkable, exceptional or legendary items in a craft increases your chances to craft such an item. Decayable items (such as food) also gain decay bonuses from using higher quality items in the craft.<br /><br />You can find new crafting recipes by gathering the required items in your inventory and by finding old instructional scrolls."],

	[Hint.Encumberance]: ["Encumberance", "The first level of encumberance will slow down your movement and reduce stamina regeneration. The second level, \"overburdened\" will physically hurt you as you will begin to take damage while trying to move. You can drop items from your inventory by right clicking, through the item's menu, or by dragging and dropping them on to the game screen."],

	[Hint.DailyChallengeMode]: ["Daily Challenge Mode", "Daily challenge mode is an extra difficult game mode with some unique game rules to add an extra challenge for skilled players. You can expect more creatures, a harder beginning of the game, and more. You cannot save your game in this mode. The world and randomization is unique per day, allowing multiple players to play in the same set of circumstances."],

	[Hint.MovingItems]: ["Moving Items", "There are many ways to organize and move items in Wayward<br /><br />1. Dragging and dropping: You can drag and drop items into a container window, quickslot, equipment slot, or directly on to the ground, by dragging it to the desired location. Dragging and dropping to the game screen will drop it in front of you, or inside a chest if you are facing one. Holding Shift while dragging will drag/drop all items of the same type.<br />2. From the item's menu. Right clicking an item will display the item's menu with options to \"Drop/Drop All\", or if you have a container window open, will present you the option to \"Move/Move All\". If you click an item that has a special quality, additional options will be visible to Drop/Move all of the same quality.<br />3. Right clicking/dropping. You can shift + right click any item in your inventory to drop it in front of you. This will automatically drop it into a chest if you are facing one.<br /><br />Note: You can change the default drop direction from the facing tile to underneath your character in the game's option menu."],

	[Hint.CraftingFailure]: ["Crafting Failure", "All crafts in Wayward have a skill level assosiated with them. Hovering over each craft will reveal the item's craft skill level. These levels going from easiest to harder are: simple, intermediate, advanced, and expert.<br /><br />Trying to craft an item with a higher skill level than your own crafting skill can sometimes result in failure. Your chance to successfully craft the item raises as your skills increase. If the item's skill level appears in orange, you will have a low chance at success for crafting that item. Each unsucessful attempt at crafting will reduce the durability of each item involved in the craft."],

	[Hint.Reputation]: ["Reputation", "These lands are mysterious and seem to react to your presence and actions. Crafting and using items, killing creatures, and performing skills will all effect your malignity and benignity, and thus your reputation. The lower your reputation becomes, the more challenging survival becomes. Having a high reputation assumes you are peaceful, and these lands will act in kindness towards you by not allowing more difficult creatures to spawn. Certain peaceful actions may increase your reputation and benignity such as gardening or planting mushrooms and plants. Travelling away to other lands using boats can significantly increase your reputation as well.<br /><br />Caves will always feature the same creatures, regardless of reputation and during the night, if your reputation is below 0, some very dangerous creatures can spawn."],

	[Hint.Interface]: ["Interface", "The windowed interface in Wayward is completely customizable. You can move them around as you see fit, and resize them to expand the information that is viewable. Move them around by dragging the title bar of each window. Resize them by dragging the corner of the window.<br /><br />If you are still having issues finding certain items within the inventory or crafting windows, try using the filter or sorting features."],

	[Hint.CreatureTaming]: ["Creature Taming", `Violence is sometimes not the best option! Besides running away from a confrontation with the hostile island creatures, another option is to attempt to tame them. To attempt creature taming, simply face the creature and select "Tame" from your action menu (opened with {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Actions)}).<br /><br />Sometimes attempting to calm the creature directly will not be enough. You can also attempt to offer an item to creature. Simply face the creature, open a item's menu and select "Offer". If the creature likes or wants the item, it will become tamed.`],

	[Hint.Combat]: ["Combat", `Engaging in combat with creatures may not be the best option. In Wayward, you are free to attempt to kill creatures as well as tame or flee from them. The strategy is up to you!<br /><br />Many skills play an important role in your successfulness at slaying the creature. Open your skills window using {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Skills)} and view the hints provided when hovering over skills such as tactics and parrying. Skills are not the only important factor when battling creatures. Your weaponry and armaments also play a role. The combat messages will tell you of your effectivenesses and inadequacies when in combat.`],

	[Hint.Quickslots]: ["Quickslots", `Opening an item's menu to perform actions can be tiresome. You can drag any item into one of your 9 quickslots and use the {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.One)}, {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Two)}, {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Three)}, {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Four)}, {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Five)}, {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Six)}, {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Seven)}, {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Eight)}, {ui.getStringForKeyBind(KeyBind.Nine)} keybinds to perform the default action for the item. Alternatively, you can also open the item's menu and select \"Add to Quickslot\" to add it to an available slot in your quickslots bar.<br /><br />You can select the default action by right clicking the item in your quickslot and clicking the x icon next to the action, turning it into a √.`],

	[Hint.ResourceGathering]: ["Resource Gathering", "To gather resources from trees or rocks, simply move into them (this feature can be disabled in options). You may not always succeed in gathering materials (the chances are based on your skill and tool). You will use whatever is in your hands to gather. You can choose what tool specifically is used in either your left or right hand by selecting which to use at the bottom of your equipment menu. It is harmful to try to resource gather without tools.<br /><br />Alternatively, if you do not want to use what you are holding, you use an item's \"Gather\" action from its menu by right clicking on it. You can make this easier by quickslotting it. Review the \"Quickslots\" hint for more information on this functionality.<br /><br />Some resources are not gathered in this fashion. Things like small plants and other objects attached to the ground (referred to as doodads) require different methods. Review the \"Doodads\" hint for more information on these items."]
