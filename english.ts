	[Hint.Controls]: ["Controls", `Keybinds can be changed under "Keybinds" in the Options menu.<br>
	
	<h3>Window Shortcuts</h3><br>
	
	{Bindable.GamePause}: Pause Menu<br>
	{Bindable.DialogCloseAll}: Close all Dialogs<br>
	{Bindable.DialogInventory}: Inventory<br>
	{Bindable.DialogEquipment}: Equipment<br>
	{Bindable.DialogCrafting}: Crafting<br>
	{Bindable.DialogHelp}: Help<br>

	{Bindable.DialogMilestones}: Milestones<br>
	For more binds, see the Controls section of the Options menu.
	
	<h3>Movement</h3><br>
	
	To move, you can use {Bindable.GameMoveUp}, {Bindable.GameMoveLeft}, {Bindable.GameMoveDown}, {Bindable.GameMoveRight} to move up, left, down, or right, respectively, or press {Bindable.GameMoveDirection}, to move towards your mouse. To skip/pass a turn, or to pick up item(s) on the tile you are standing on, press {Bindable.GameIdle} or use {Bindable.GameMoveDirection} with your mouse over your character. If you want to face a direction without moving, you can hold down {Bindable.GameFaceDirection} and your character will face towards your mouse. You can also use {Bindable.GameFaceUp}, {Bindable.GameFaceLeft}, {Bindable.GameFaceDown}, or {Bindable.GameFaceRight} to face up, left, down, or right, again, respectively. If there is too much or too little delay between turning a direction and moving, you can fine-tune it in the Gameplay section of the Options menu.<br>
	
	<h3>Actions</h3><br>
	
	Opening up the Actions menu ({Bindable.GameActions}) will bring up a list of actions you can perform on the adjacent tile or object; for example, collecting a pineapple without needing to carve it up. Jumping is also selectable in the actions menu which can help you get out of tight spots, but watch out for the heavy stamina reduction; it's based on your current weight.<br>
	
	<h3>Using Items</h3><br>
	
	Use {Bindable.GameItemMenu} when hovering over an item with the mouse to bring up a list of actions you can perform with the item. Using quickslots, you may also perform actions with an item at the press of a bind. To quickslot an item, use the action "Add to Quickslot", drag the item to a quickslot, or press any of the quickslot binds ({Bindable.GameQuickSlot1}, {Bindable.GameQuickSlot2}, etc). Once an item is quickslotted, you can use its configured action at any time by pressing its quickslot bind.<br>
	
	<h3>Item Management</h3><br>
	
	To drop an item quickly, you may press {Bindable.GameItemDrop} when hovering over an item. You can also use the "Drop All" option from the item's menu or press {Bindable.GameItemDropAll} to drop multiple of the same kind of item. If there is a tile in the way of your drop, nothing will happen. You may change this functionality and instead drop the item at your feet with the setting "Drop at Feet When Blocked", available in the Gameplay section of the Options menu and the Quick Settings dialog.<br><br>
	
	To move an item quickly from your inventory to a container or vice-versa, you may press {Bindable.GameItemQuickMove} when hovering an item. If there is no open container and there is a container in the direction your character is facing, you will place the item into the container. You may also press {Bindable.GameItemQuickMoveAll} to move all items of the same type.<br><br>
	
	<h3>More Information</h3><br>
	
	Hovering over elements on screen will typically reveal more information. Tooltips will appear over items. Hovering over crafting items will highlight items used in the craft. Many objects in the world also have tooltips, unless they are disabled. If they are disabled, you can still get information about the tile you are hovering over with {Bindable.GameInspect}.<br>`],

	[Hint.CorpseCarving]: ["Corpse Carving", `To harvest potential resources from corpses, you must carve them with a sharp item. Choose "Carve" from the item's menu or try moving it to a quickslot for ease of use.`],

	[Hint.Doodads]: ["Doodads", `Doodads are considered objects attached to the ground like plants, piles of rocks, furnaces, campfires, etc. To collect them, you can do one of the following:<br><br>
	
	1. While facing the item, click or press the "Actions" ({Bindable.GameActions}), and select the "Collect Object With Hands" option.<br>
	2. Use an item with "Digging" such as a stone shovel.<br>
	3. Use an item with "Carving" such as a sharp rock.<br>
	4. Use an item with "Gather" such as a wooden pole.<br>
	5. Use an item with "Harvest" such as a stone knife.<br><br>
	
	Using your bare hands with no tool (option 1) can sometimes harm you. Using a tool (option 2/3/4/5) will decrease the durability of the item. Some objects may require a "Carving" tool such as corpses to harvest from them.`],

	[Hint.Caves]: ["Caves", "Caves are the perfect place for hidden treasure, but first, they may need illumination with a torch to explore them further. Caves can be extremely dangerous and may require advanced armor and weaponry."],

	[Hint.Nightfall]: ["Nightfall", "If nightfall is approaching, find a safe area to camp out and prepare yourself for combat! Many tough creatures can prowl the night."],

	[Hint.StaminaReplenishment]: ["Stamina Replenishment", "If you find yourself getting exhausted, sleep or rest using a bedroll or hammock to regenerate stamina. You can also rest by going into the Actions menu and selecting \"Rest\"; however, resting with an item will produce better regenerative effects. Rest is different from sleep in that you will only ever rest until your stamina is maxed out. Alternatively, you may hold spacebar or click your character to skip turns."],

	[Hint.HealthProblems]: ["Health Problems", "If you find yourself injured, you replenish your health with food or healing-type items. Some status effects reduce your ability to regenerate your health including bleeding and poisoning. Alternatively, you can also try sleeping or resting to regenerate health."],

	[Hint.Bleeding]: ["Bleeding", "The bleeding status effect is usually the result of a low anatomy skill percentage while fighting a tough creature. Make sure to use a healing item to stop the bleeding, such as a bandage or tourniquet. Bleeding causes you to starve/dehydrate faster, regenerate stamina slower, and stops regeneration of health."],

	[Hint.Poisoned]: ["Poisoned", "Poisoning can happen from eating bad things or from some types of creatures. Make sure to use a curing item to cure the poison, such as medicinal water. Poisoning causes you to starve/dehydrate faster, regenerate stamina slower, and stops regeneration of health."],

	[Hint.Dehydration]: ["Dehydration", "There's many ways to get drinkable water, but unfortunately for you, the largest source of water, from the sea is nearly undrinkable in its raw form. You must desalinate the water through the use of a water still or flask before drinking it without adverse effects. Alternatively, you may seek out a fresh water source, such as from caves, small lakes, oases, swamps or ponds. Fresh water is drinkable in it's raw form without too many bad effects; however, you may still want to boil it for the best health results."],

	[Hint.UseATool]: ["Use A Tool", `Gathering resources with your hands is difficult and harmful; try equipping or using a tool to eliminate the chance of injury. Quickslotting an item can help you control the exact tool you wish to use for fast usage.<br><br>
	
	If you are mining or lumberjacking, your weapon(s) attack value will also help gather items faster. Blunt attack weapon will help you gather faster while mining, while slashing weapons will help you gather faster while lumberjacking.`],

	[Hint.Durability]: ["Durability", "If you find your armor, tools or weapons are close to breaking from overuse (highlighted with a red border), you will need to repair it using a hammer item or a grindstone. If you can't find or craft an item to repair it, it will soon break completely upon use."],

	[Hint.Death]: ["Death", "Death is permanent. Although you may have died, all of the crafting recipes you have discovered will be ready on your next playthrough. Your milestones will also carry over, providing you multiple starting benefits."],

	[Hint.ConsumingBadThings]: ["Consuming Bad Things", "Ow! Not all edible/drinkable objects should be consumed, at least not without facing the consequences. On the other hand, sometimes it's worth the risk to gain its other effects. Consuming bad things can sometimes result in poisoning."],

	[Hint.FastPickup]: ["Fast Pick-up", "You have just picked up an item from the ground. Sometimes there are multiple items on a tile. Pressing the spacebar or clicking on your character will gather items underneath you without moving."],

	[Hint.Bugs]: ["BUGS!", 'Did you find an error? Would you kindly let us know about what happened, so that we may seek to stop this from happening to other players? You can do so by posting the issue in the <a target="_blank" href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/379210/discussions/1/">Steam Discussions Bug Reports forum</a>.'],

	[Hint.HeldItems]: ["Held Items", `Your left and right hand equipment slots are interchangeable. You can equip two weapons, two tools, two shields or any combination in between. With both the left and right hand options selected, you will use both hands (and whatever is equipped in each slot) in combat and in gathering. You can disable either the left or right hands to disable using that one in attacking and gathering. Disabling both will prevent you from attacking or gathering automatically.<br><br>
	
	To receive a parrying defense bonus, you must be holding an item in each hand (one to parry with, one to fight with).`],

	[Hint.Milestones]: ["Milestones", "Milestones are personalized goals and achievements. Each playthrough, you are given an amount to either discover or work towards. Milestones are saved after each playthrough or death. The more you have completed, the more starting skill and stat points you get, as well as more starting items."],

	[Hint.Burned]: ["Burn Injuries", "Lasting burn injuries and pain can be caused from stepping in an open flame without protection, or possibly other sources. Pouring liquid on yourself will soothe the injuries and pain. Alternatively, you can also take a swim in deep water. Keep swimming until the effect subsides. Being burned will stop you from regenerating health and can last awhile if untreated."],

	[Hint.Crafting]: ["Crafting", `Crafting is simple, but has many rules!<br><br>
	
	When hovering over an item in the crafting window, you will see which items will be used in the craft through a highlighted border that will appear around items in your inventory. You will also notice that you will use the first instance of a required item. Simply drag around the order of items in your inventory or use the sort to use different items in the craft.<br><br>
	
	Using items in a craft that have lower durability will affect the crafted item's durability. Additionally, using remarkable, exceptional or legendary items in a craft increases your chances to craft such an item. Decayable items (such as food) also gain decay bonuses from using higher quality items in the craft.<br><br>
	
	You can find new crafting recipes by gathering the required items in your inventory and by finding old instructional scrolls.`],

	[Hint.Encumberance]: ["Encumberance", `The first level of encumberance will slow down your movement and reduce stamina regeneration. The second level, "overburdened" will physically hurt you as you will begin to take damage while trying to move. You can drop items from your inventory by right clicking, through the item's menu, or by dragging and dropping them on to the game screen.`],

	[Hint.MovingItems]: ["Moving Items", `There are many ways to organize and move items in Wayward.<br><br>
	
	1. Drag and Drop: By holding {Bindable.GameItemMove}, you may drag and drop items into a container window, quickslot, equipment slot, or directly on to the ground. Dragging and dropping to the game screen will drop it in front of you, or inside a chest if you are facing one.<br>
	2. Quickmoving: With {Bindable.GameItemQuickMove} you can move an item instantly from your inventory to a container or vice-versa. You can use this while the container is not open, if your character is facing towards it. You may also use {Bindable.GameItemQuickMoveAll} to instantly move all items of the same type.
	2. From the item's menu: Right clicking an item will display the item's menu with options to "Drop/Drop All", or if you have a container window open, will present you the option to "Move/Move All". If you click an item that has a special quality, additional options will be visible to Drop/Move all of the same quality.<br>
	3. Dropping items: By pressing {Bindable.GameItemDrop}, you may drop an item onto the ground. If the tile in front of you is blocked, nothing will happen, or the item will be dropped at your feet, if your Drop Location is set to "Drop at Feet When Blocked". You may also press {Bindable.GameItemDropAll} to drop all items of the same type.`],

	[Hint.CraftingFailure]: ["Crafting Failure", `All crafts in Wayward have a skill level assosiated with them. Hovering over each craft will reveal the item's craft skill level. These levels going from easiest to harder are: simple, intermediate, advanced, and expert.<br><br>
	
	Trying to craft an item with a higher skill level than your own crafting skill can sometimes result in failure. Your chance to successfully craft the item raises as your skills increase. If the item's skill level appears in orange, you will have a low chance at success for crafting that item. Each unsucessful attempt at crafting will reduce the durability of each item involved in the craft.`],

	[Hint.Reputation]: ["Reputation", `These lands are mysterious and seem to react to your presence and actions. Crafting and using items, killing creatures, and performing skills will all effect your malignity and benignity, and thus your reputation. The lower your reputation becomes, the more challenging survival becomes. Having a high reputation assumes you are peaceful, and these lands will act in kindness towards you by not allowing more difficult creatures to spawn. Certain peaceful actions may increase your reputation and benignity such as gardening or planting mushrooms and plants. Travelling away to other lands using boats can significantly increase your reputation as well.<br><br>
	
	Caves will always feature the same creatures, regardless of reputation and during the night, if your reputation is below 0, some very dangerous creatures can spawn.`],

	[Hint.Interface]: ["Interface", `The windowed interface in Wayward is completely customizable. You can move them around as you see fit, and resize them to expand the information that is viewable. Move them around by dragging the title bar of each window. Resize them by dragging the corner of the window.<br><br>
	
	If you are still having issues finding certain items within the inventory or crafting windows, try using the filter or sorting features.`],

	[Hint.CreatureTaming]: ["Creature Taming", `Violence is sometimes not the best option! Besides running away from a confrontation with the hostile island creatures, another option is to attempt to tame them. To attempt creature taming, simply face the creature and select "Tame" from your action menu (opened with {Bindable.GameActions}).<br><br>
	
	Sometimes attempting to calm the creature directly will not be enough. You can also attempt to offer an item to creature. Simply face the creature, open a item's menu and select "Offer". If the creature likes or wants the item, it will become tamed. Aberrant creatures can sometimes require multiple item offerings before they will become tamed. All of these actions are based on chance and your taming skill.`],

	[Hint.Combat]: ["Combat", `Engaging in combat with creatures may not be the best option. In Wayward, you are free to attempt to kill creatures as well as tame or flee from them. The strategy is up to you!<br><br>
	
	Many skills play an important role in your successfulness at slaying the creature. Open your skills window using {Bindable.DialogSkills} and view the hints provided when hovering over skills such as tactics and parrying. Skills are not the only important factor when battling creatures. Your weaponry and armaments also play a role. The combat messages will tell you of your effectivenesses and inadequacies when in combat. When holding two items (one in each hand), you will also receive a parrying defense bonus (based on your parrying skill).`],

	[Hint.Quickslots]: ["Quickslots", `Opening an item's menu to perform actions can be tiresome. Quickslots are for using an action on an item with the press of a bind.<br>
	
	<h3>Quickslotting an Item</h3><br>
	
	You can drag any item into one of your 9 quickslots to quickslot the item in that slot. You can also use any of the quickslot binds to toggle the item being quickslotted to the slot of the bind you press.<br>
	
	Alternatively, you can open an item's menu and select "Add to Quickslot" to add it to an open quickslot.<br>
	
	<h3>Using a Quickslotted Item</h3><br>
	
	By default, pressing the bind for a quickslot will perform the default action for the item in that slot. You can change the action to perform for a quickslot item by opening the actions menu for the item in the quickslot, and clicking the x icon next to the preferred action, turning it into a √.<br>
	
	<h3>Removing a Quickslotted Item</h3><br>
	
	There are two binds provided for removing items from quickslots. You can press {Bindable.GameQuickSlotClear} to clear the hovered item from its quickslot, or to clear the hovered quickslot. You can also press any of the quickslot binds to toggle the hovered item being quickslotted to that slot.`],

	[Hint.ResourceGathering]: ["Resource Gathering", `To gather resources from trees or rocks, simply move into them (this feature can be disabled in options). You may not always succeed in gathering materials (the chances are based on your skill and tool). You will use whatever is in your hands to gather. You can choose what tool specifically is used in either your left or right hand by selecting which to use at the bottom of your equipment menu. It is harmful to try to resource gather without tools.<br><br>
	
	Alternatively, if you do not want to use what you are holding, you can use an item's "Gather" action from its menu. You can make this easier by quickslotting it. Review the "Quickslots" hint for more information on this functionality.<br><br>
	
	Some resources are not gathered in this fashion. Things like small plants and other objects attached to the ground (referred to as doodads) require different methods. Review the "Doodads" hint for more information on these items.`],

	[Hint.Multiplayer]: ["Multiplayer", `Multiplayer in Wayward is enabled for up to 32 players. Multiplayer works on a simulated real-time mode where each turn happens on a fixed interval. Casual and Hardcore modes work a bit differently than in single player. Casual mode allows players to respawn as per normal, but in Hardcore mode, when you die you will continue to play in ghost form, allowing you to spectate but not interact normally. Multiplayer also allows for a special PVP flag to be set to allow players to hurt and kill other players. Multiplayer options can be set in the multiplayer menu via the pause menu accessed with {Bindable.GamePause}.<br><br>
	
	Creature spawn rates, creature difficulty, and reputation are all based on how many connected players there are and will scale and average based on each individual player.<br>
	<h3>Commands</h3><br>
	You can use several special commands while playing multiplayer. To see a list of all possible commands, type "/commands" in the chat bar and hit enter. The following commands are also available for use:<br><br>
	
	/players – Shows a list of all connected players.<br>
	/ping – Shows your latency to the host player.<br>
	/kick – Allows the host to kick a player.<br>
	/banned – Shows a list of all banned players.<br>
	/ban – Allows the host to ban a player.<br>
	/unban – Allows the host to unban a player.`],

	[Hint.Gardening]: ["Gardening", `The full plant life cycle is represented in Wayward. In order, these are: germinating, seedling, vegetative, budding, flowering, ripening, and dead. Fungus follows the same steps, but are named: germinating, spreading, forming, young, fruiting, and full.<br><br>
	
	Each of the steps means something different for each plant and fungus. Every plant is unique, including the resources you can gather or harvest from each of them. If you attempt to gather from a plant too early, you may not get the full amount of resources.<br><br>
		
	Gathering is a destructive process, meaning, you will attempt to gather everything from the plant. Some vegetables and fruits require this to get the edible portion, such as potatoes or carrots for example.<br><br>
		
	Harvesting a plant will only attempt to get what will keep the plant alive and/or sustainable. This is not always an option for all plants, and sometimes will only result in getting their seeds.<br><br>
		
	You can attempt to water plants (by using the "Pour" action on water containers) or plant them on fertile soil to reduce their growth time and increase their fertility for spreading.
